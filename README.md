# fedora-rpms

Repository of packages that I use on Fedora systems that aren't included in
the official distribution.  Packages are automatically built from these spec
files and published on [COPR](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/mrichardson03/fedora-rpms/).

## Usage

Enable COPR repository, then install packages:

```bash
sudo dnf copr enable mrichardson03/fedora-rpms
```
